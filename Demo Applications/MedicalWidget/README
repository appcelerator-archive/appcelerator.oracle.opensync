Oracle Mobile Database Server HealthCare Demo

The HealthCare demo application is a port of the native demo app provided by Oracle.
The application is a tabbed application with three tabs:

	1. Sync - Synchronization with the Mobile Data Server
	2. PulseO2 - Patient selection and navigation of Pulse/Oxygen readings
	3. BP - Blood pressure readings. This tab was not implemented in the demo app provide by Oracle

The Oracle demo was designed to have medical device connected to the server and have it generate new 
readings (pulse/O2/BP) which were in turn updated in the databse. The new readings are then downloaded
to the client each time it synchronizes with the server. Currently, our demo does not have a mechanism
for adding new data to the database.

Sync Tab:

This tab is used to synchronize with the backend Mobile Data Server (MDS). The MDS has been set up
and is pre-populated with a minimal set of data. To synchronize,

	1. Enter a registered user name ('MWELBY')
	2. Enter the password for the user ('mwelby')
	3. Check the box to save the password
	4. Enter the url for the server (contact IT to get the correct address)
	5. Click 'Sync'

If successful, the status text field will indicate a successful synchronization. You only need to
synchronize with the server when there are changes to the database (either on the client or server).

Pulse/O2 Tab:

This tab is used to select a patient and navigate through their Pulse and Oxygen level readings. The 'Load'
button is used to load the data from the current user's database (each user has a separate database on the client).

	1. Click the 'Load' button to load the database for the current user
	2. Click the 'Select Patient' picker and select a patient. The first reading for that patient should be displayed.
	3. Click the 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons to navigate through the readings for the selected patient

BP Tab:

This tab was not implemented in the demo app provided by Oracle
